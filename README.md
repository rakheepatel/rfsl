# Robot Framework - Selenium Library keywords tests
Using a [dummy html page](http://gigaplex.homeip.net/ra/index.html) as a base, all Selenium 2 Library keywords have been used in context.
This repo is mostly for beginners to understand how the examples in the [Selenium2Library](http://robotframework.org/Selenium2Library/Selenium2Library.html) documentation should be used. I have tried to keep things as simple as possible.
**Update: Selenium2Library has been deprecated. I have yet to update the keywords**

## I am a beginner, what should I do? :baby:
I suggest you fork this repo and clone it onto your local machine. This will allow you to play around with the keywords, change locators, and find better solutions.
You also get a chance to change the kitten pics to something that might suit you better :stuck_out_tongue:

## I'm a pro, and this is too basic. It could be better :smirk:
Yes. It could. However, once again, I've tried to keep things as simple as I could to allow beginners to get their heads around how some of these keywords should be used.

## I found a problem with your code, and I fixed it :blush:
Great! :thumbsup: Please, create a pull request!

## This is Ace :ok_hand:, but you know what would be better? The same thing, but with other libraries!
IKR! How about you give me a hand?
